I'm a PhD Candidate at the [Artificial Intelligence group](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/plant-sciences/artificial-intelligence-group-1.htm) at Wageningen University & Research under the supervision of [Ioannis Athanasiadis](https://www.athanasiadis.info/) and [Diego Marcos](https://sites.google.com/view/diego-marcos). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and its application in agriculture.
